# Magic Mirrors [FABRIC]

## About

This project is a rewrite of the Forge mod 'Magic Mirrors'
It allows a player to teleport to its spawn point using a magic mirror, however, for dimensional travel,an upgrade to the mirror is required. To upgrade the mirror, you will require a Dimensional Crystal, which can be crafted using a netherite ingot and soul soil.

## TODOs
